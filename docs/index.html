            <li>Being the organizer of a Meetup there are times when you can't find a presenter and you need to step up.
            <li>I keep a list of topics that I am interested in learning so that if I need step up at least I can learn something new.
            <li>And like usual I started the day before the Meetup
            <li>That day I taught myself Vue</li>
            <li>This was very surprising to me.  I learned it and built an app with it in the same day</li>
            <li>Not only did the app work but I had confidence that it was built with best practices. And I was able to teach others the next day</li>

            <li class="fragment">Robust toolchain</li>

          <aside class="notes">
            <li>The Documentation for me is the gold standard for an open source project.
              Explanations, Examples.
            <li>Toolchain even more so with CLI v3 with the new scaffolding and the Plugin Architecture
            <li>Batteries included if you want them. This is one of my favorite things about Vue. It provides
              you with a path to include libs like router or vuex. Sometimes opionions are liberating.
            <li>I am a big proponent for Typescript.
              Happy to hear Vue 3 is going to be written in TypeScript

            <li>--------------</li>
            <li>We have analytics and almost every country in the world uses Ionic today.
            <li>Except for one. North Korea
            <li>--------------</li>
            <li>The components range from buttons, to dialogs, to form toggles, inputs, alerts.
            <li>One of the things that is very unique about all of our components is that they are built
              for both iOS and Material Design.
            <li>So it is a truly cross platform codebase. Build your app once and it will appear as Material for Android
              and as iOS on an Apple Product.
            <li>We also provide a set of components and APIs that allow you to interact with native device APIs.
              An example of this would be push notifications, haptic feedback, geo location, camera and a number
              of others

            <li>Beautiful design - We place a lot of value on the quality of our component designs. The nice thing
              is that it just looks this great out of the box.
            <li>Notice that components reflect the native behavior for material design or for iOS such from Action Sheets or alerts.
            <li>Ionic also provides tabs and stacked routing which is expected for mobile applications.
            <li>We have 2 svg based icon sets as well. One for iOS and one for Material.  You might have used them before.
               Aptly named Ionicons</li>
            <li>Robust theming system based on css variables. So you can create a theme specific to your brand or change
              your themes real time in a white labeled application. This is a nice advantage over using something like sass.
