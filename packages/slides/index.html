              I presented directly before Max, so obviously my slide deck on
              intro to Node and Express was overshadowed. And a few years later I went to work for him.

            <li>This was very surprising to me.  I learned it and built an app with it in the same day</li>

            <li>The Documentation for me is the gold standard for an open source project.
              Explanations, Examples.
            <li>Toolchain even more so with CLI v3 with the new scaffolding and the Plugin Architecture
            <li>Batteries included if you want them. This is one of my favorite things about Vue. It provides
              you with a path to include libs like router or vuex. Sometimes opionions are liberating.
            <li>I am a big proponent for Typescript.
              Happy to hear Vue 3 is going to be written in TypeScript

            HOW IONIC FITS TOGETHER
            <li>Ionic is a framework for creating high quality applications
            <li>It is a collection of CSS + Javascript resources
            <li>We call it the Ionic Framework because we provide more value than just components.
            <li>--------------</li>
            <li>The code is built in such a way that its components can be used with a number
              of different frameworks.
            <li>We currently only offically support Angular and Vanilla JS</li>
            <li>But this is changing very soon</li>
            <li>--------------</li>
            <li>Ionic also provides solutions for your appliction to interact with native devices through bridges</li>
            <li>We have 2 ways of accomplishing this. One of these is Cordova and the other is Capacitor which I will be talking about later</li>
            <li>This means that you can also deploy your application to iOS, Android, and Electron. Obviously you can also ship it as a PWA</li>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>What is Ionic?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>5M + Apps created</li>
            <li>30K+ Stack Overflow Questions</li>
            <li>100+ Meetups</li>
            <li>Open Source and MIT licensed</li>
            <li class="fragment">Collection of over 100 components</li>
            <li class="fragment">Cross-platform apps with a single codebase</li>
            <li class="fragment">Use a native bridge for device apis</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <li>Our stats show that Monthly almost every country in the world uses Ionic today.
            <li>Except for one. North Korea
            <li>The components range from buttons, to dialogs to form toggles, inputs, alerts.
            <li>One of the things that is very unique about all of our components is that they are built
              for both iOS and Material Design.
            <li>So it is a truly cross platform codebase. Build it once and it will appear as Material for Android
              and as iOS on an Apple Product.
            <li>We also provide a set of components and APIs that allow you to interact with native device APIs.
              An example of this would be push notifications, haptic feedback, geo location, camera and a number
              of others

          <aside class="notes">
            <li>Beautiful design - We place a lot of value on the quality of our component designs. The nice thing
              is that it just looks this great out of the box.
            <li>Notice that components reflect the native behavior for material design or for iOS such from Action Sheets or dialogs.
            <li>We have 2 svg based icon sets as well. One for iOS and one for Material.  You might have used them before.
               Aptly named Ionicons</li>
            <li>Robust theming system based on css variables. So you can create a theme specific to your brand or change
              your themes real time in a white labeled application. This is a nice advantage over using something like sass.

          <aside class="notes">
            <li>Our documentation provides live examples, best practices, and example code.
            <li>All supported frameworks also have code that corresponds to the live examples.
            <li>Ionic is written entirely in Typescript so our API documentation gets generated on release
              to ensure that they stay up to date.  Nothing worse than outdated documenatation.

            Web App - Shared Codebase. Not code sharing this is a single codebase

            <li>We have always been built with Angular.
